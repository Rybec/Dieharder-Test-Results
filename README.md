# Dieharder Test Results Repository

This is a repository of Dieharder test results, intended to be used for comparison purposes.  The intent is to use this to provide free public access to tests done in "Test to Destruction" mode, which take months to complete even for fast PRNGs on high end hardware, as a reference so that they don't need to be repeated each time someone new needs them.

If this is useful to you, and you _want_ to contribute something in return, you can provide attribution to Ben Williams or cite this repository, or you can donate BAT to this Github account (https://github.com/Rybec/) using the Brave browser.  This is not required, but it would certainly be appreciated!
